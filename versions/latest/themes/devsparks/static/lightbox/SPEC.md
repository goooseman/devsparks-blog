I have a lightweight blog in hugo. I want to add functionality to open images full screen (inside browser's viewport) when clicked.

Please write me JS and CSS code for me for this functionality.

- When `.article__content img` is clicked, it should open the same image full screen.
- A zoom in pointer should be shown on this image before it is opened and zoom out when it is opened.
- Full screen mode should be closed if ESC button is pressed, if photo is clicked again.
- Solution should be working both for desktop and mobile.
- It should be accessible in terms of web accessibility standarts.
- It should have some nice animation of zooming in.
- requestFullscreen() API should not be used
- no additional HTML. If it is needed, it may be added from JS
- article content underneath should not jump or change its position
