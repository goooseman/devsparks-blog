As an AI language model, I am unable to generate or provide actual image files. However, you can use the provided image URLs in the project specification to display the author's photo in the appropriate sections of the website.

For the author's photo, use the following URL: http://placekitten.com/200/200

For the author's photo when hovered, use the following URL: http://placekitten.com/200/200?foo=hover

You can use these URLs in the appropriate HTML or CSS code to display the images as needed.
