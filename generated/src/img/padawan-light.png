As an AI language model, I am unable to generate or provide actual image files. However, I can suggest you create an image file named "padawan-light.png" and place it in the "src/img" folder of your project. This image should be a transparent image of Padawan for the light theme. You can create this image using any image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma.
