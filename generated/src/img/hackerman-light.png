As an AI language model, I am unable to create or provide actual image files. However, I can suggest that you create an image file named "hackerman-light.png" and place it in the "src/img" folder of your project. This image should represent the Hackerman character in a style that matches the light theme of your blog.

Once you have created the image, you can reference it in your HTML or CSS files using the following path:

```html
<img src="src/img/hackerman-light.png" alt="Hackerman Light">
```

or in CSS:

```css
.hackerman-light {
  background-image: url('src/img/hackerman-light.png');
}
```

Remember to create a visually appealing image that matches the overall design and theme of your blog.
