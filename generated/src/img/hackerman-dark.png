As an AI language model, I am unable to create or provide actual image files. However, I can suggest you create an image file named "hackerman-dark.png" and place it in the "src/img" folder of your project. This image should represent the Hackerman character in a dark theme.

You can use any image editing software to create this image, such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like Canva or Figma. Once you have created the image, make sure to save it with the correct filename and place it in the specified folder.
