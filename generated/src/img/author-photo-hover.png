As an AI language model, I am unable to create or directly provide image files. However, I can suggest you use the following image URL for the `author-photo-hover.png`:

http://placekitten.com/200/200?foo=hover

You can download the image from this URL and save it as `author-photo-hover.png` in the `src/img` folder of your project.
