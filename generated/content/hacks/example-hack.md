For those who are new to the command line, here's a quick tip to get you started. To navigate through your file system, you can use the `cd` command followed by the directory you want to go to. For example:

```
cd my-awesome-project
```

And to go back to the previous directory, just type:

```
cd ..
```

Now, let's dive into some more advanced CLI magic. Did you know you can create a new Git branch and switch to it in one command? Just use the `-b` flag with `git checkout`:

```
git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch
```

That's it! You've now created a new branch and switched to it. Happy coding!
