  <h3>Basic CLI Commands</h3>
  <p>Before we get into the advanced stuff, let's make sure you've got the basics down. Here are some essential CLI commands every developer should know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>cd</code> - change directory</li>
    <li><code>ls</code> - list files and directories</li>
    <li><code>mkdir</code> - create a new directory</li>
    <li><code>touch</code> - create a new file</li>

## Hackerman's Tip

  <h3>Powerful Git Aliases</h3>
  <p>Want to level up your Git game? Try adding these handy aliases to your <code>.gitconfig</code> file:</p>
  <pre><code>[alias]
  st = status
  ci = commit
  co = checkout
  br = branch
  lg = log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  </code></pre>
  <p>Now you can use short commands like <code>git st</code> instead of <code>git status</code> for a faster and more efficient workflow!</p>
