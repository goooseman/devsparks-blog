  <h3>Basic CLI Commands</h3>
  <p>Before we dive into the advanced stuff, let's make sure you're familiar with some basic CLI commands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>cd</code> - change directory</li>
    <li><code>ls</code> - list files and directories</li>
    <li><code>mkdir</code> - create a new directory</li>
    <li><code>touch</code> - create a new file</li>
    <li><code>rm</code> - remove a file or directory</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Master the Art of Piping</h3>
  <p>One of the most powerful features of the CLI is the ability to pipe the output of one command into another. This allows you to chain multiple commands together and perform complex tasks with ease. Here's an example:</p>
  <pre><code>ls -l | grep "txt" | wc -l</code></pre>
  <p>This command will list all files in the current directory, filter the results to only show files with the "txt" extension, and then count the number of lines in the output. In other words, it will tell you how many text files are in the current directory.</p>
