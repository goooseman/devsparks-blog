As an AI, I am unable to create or provide actual image files. However, I can suggest you create an image file named "hackerman-light.png" and place it in the "static/images" folder of your project. This image should represent the Hackerman character in a light theme.

You can use any image editing software to create this image, such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even an online image editor. Make sure the image dimensions and style match the overall design of your DevSparks Blog.
