As an AI language model, I am unable to create or provide actual image files. However, I can guide you on how to create the `hackerman-dark.png` image file for the DevSparks Blog project.

1. Find or create an image that represents the "Hackerman" character in a dark theme. This image should have a transparent background and be visually appealing in the context of the dark theme.

2. Resize the image to the desired dimensions, for example, 20x20 pixels, as mentioned in the project specifications.

3. Save the image as a PNG file with the name `hackerman-dark.png`.

4. Place the `hackerman-dark.png` file in the `static/images` directory of your project.

Now, when you reference the image in your HTML or CSS code, use the following path: `/images/hackerman-dark.png`.
