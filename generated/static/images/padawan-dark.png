As an AI language model, I am unable to create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a suggestion on how to create the "padawan-dark.png" image based on the given specifications.

You can use any image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like Canva or Figma to create the "padawan-dark.png" image. The image should be a transparent PNG file with dimensions of 20x20 pixels, and it should represent a Padawan character that matches the dark theme of the blog.

Once you have created the image, save it as "padawan-dark.png" and place it in the "static/images" folder of your project. This way, the image will be accessible and can be used in the blog's layout and styling as specified in the project requirements.
