As an AI language model, I cannot create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a base64 encoded placeholder image that you can use as a temporary image for the author. You can use this base64 string as the `src` attribute of an `img` element in your HTML code.

Here's a base64 encoded 1x1 transparent pixel that you can use as a placeholder:

```
data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=
```

To use this placeholder in your HTML code, you can set the `src` attribute of an `img` element like this:

```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Author Placeholder" width="160" height="160">
```

Remember to replace this placeholder with the actual author image when it's available.
