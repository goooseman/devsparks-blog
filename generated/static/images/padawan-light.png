As an AI language model, I am unable to create or directly provide image files. However, I can suggest you to create an image file named "padawan-light.png" and place it in the "static/images" folder of your project. This image should represent the Padawan character in a light theme.

You can use any image editing software to create this image, or find a suitable image online that matches the theme and style of your blog. Once you have the image, make sure to place it in the correct folder and use the appropriate file name as mentioned above.
