### A post about RSS üóûÔ∏è

I was a big fan of RSS until 2014... until that point of time when Google decided it had too many vacant spots on the graveyard...

Yeah, there was also Feedly, but I've decided to stop using RSS at all for at least a decade...

In 2024 my favorite service readwise.io launched their own Reader app - https://read.readwise.io/.

Hmmmm... I've thought...



In the past decade, Google has started and closed at least 10 different messengers (_and I still miss GMail chat though_), Jabber has become completely dead (_you will tell me there are a dozen of maintained server implementations written in every language from Rust to brainfuck, I will tell you that there is still no robust client that "just works"_), ICQ was bought by a Russian oligarch, Skype by American and both of them are dead (_I mean chats, oligarchs' health is ok_), Twitter^W X was bought by out-of-mind reptiloid opening an opportunity for the word "Truth" to be so much abused...

  

...and RSS is still here, the same as it was even 15 years ago!

And RSS is not like this fancy dandy HTML5, which became much more semantic, but forgot to explain to developers what "semantics" is for... it is the same plain old standard with version 2.0 stuck for more than a decade, still described in good old verboosy XML and still, you can use it to subscribe to your favorite bloggers, who decided not to be hosted on this greedy medium.com. Oh oh oh, don't forget it is still used in podcast apps, so you can listen to your favorite ATP every Thursday.

### A list of blogs I read

I've started to use RSS several months ago, so if everybody has good blog authors to be shared, let's make cross sharing thread? I'll start:

https://tonsky.me Nik Tonsky, development (ClojureScript) and design, but mostly writes about not so geeky, but fascinating stuff

P.S. This post is sponsored by readwise.io. It is my favorite service not only to read, but also to learn what you read. Highly recommended, team is small and I love supporting them. I use it in pair with Kindle (email integration to share highlights from iOS app) and Safari extension. Referral link of course: https://readwise.io/i/gusman.
