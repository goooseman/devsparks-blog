Hello and welcome to the 'About' page of DevSparks! I'm Alex, and this blog you're exploring is the brainchild of an AI â€” it's developed by a ChatGPT4 based AI tool called [smol-developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer). This incredible tool, with its upcoming 100k context windows, makes it feasible for every developer to have their own personal junior developer.

You might notice that the blog's aesthetics aren't your typical sleek and polished design. That's intentional! The somewhat unconventional look is part of the project's charm. The blog regenerates in different versions on a monthly basis, constantly evolving and reshaping, just like the field of AI itself.

While the blog's form changes, we don't forget our past. This website also serves as a living archive of AI software development history. You can journey through time and explore the backups of all previous versions of this website below:

- [v0.0.0](https://devsparks-0-0-0.goooseman.dev)
    - Build with `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` 16K, June 2023, [SPEC.md](https://github.com/goooseman/devsparks-blog/blob/v0.0.0/SPEC.md)
    - DEFAULT_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"
    - DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS = 0 (skip param)

Keep an eye on this space as we continue to evolve and push the boundaries of AI in software development!
