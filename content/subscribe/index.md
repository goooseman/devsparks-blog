Want to keep up with all the sparks of knowledge we're throwing out here? There are several ways to stay in the loop:

- If you're an old-school netizen who still remembers the glory days of Google Reader, you might appreciate our [RSS feed](https://devsparks.goooseman.dev/index.xml).
- For those of you who love absorbing information through video, make sure to check out our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Dev_Sparks).
- We've got a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+xsHFeSD6HDhhMjRk) too! By the way, you can authenticate your comments on our site using Telegram. We're also working on enabling Telegram notifications for comments as soon as [this issue is closed](https://github.com/umputun/remark42/issues/830#issuecomment-1605291228).
- If you're more of a WhatsApp user, we've got you covered! Here's our [WhatsApp channel](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IB353IHFJR2AGLy7Xlxkg4) where we publish all our updates.
- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DevSparks) to get all our latest updates in your feed.
- If you're an email kind of person, we don't have a direct email subscription. But, I personally recommend [this minimalistic and geeky Feedrabbit service](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions) to convert our RSS -> email notifications.
