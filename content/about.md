  <p>DevSparks is a series of short but meaningful lifehacks for developers. Each lifehack is a short but fun blog post and a small 5-15 min video.</p>
  <p>This project is a static blog, which mainly consists of those lifehacks. The posts are written in a cool way with usage of slang.</p>
  <p>The blog itself is strictly technical for at least medium-level developers. Topics are power usage of CLI, Git tricks, software development principles.</p>
