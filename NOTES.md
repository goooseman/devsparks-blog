# DevSparks Blog Specification

## Overview

DevSparks - short, but meaningful lifehacks for developers. Each lifehack is a short, but fun blog post and a small 5-15 mins video. 

This project is a static blog, which mainly consists of those lifehacks. The posts are written in a coool way with usage of slang. Also blog has "About" page.

The blog itself is strictly technical for at least medium-level developers. Topics are power usage of cli, git tricks, software development principles. 

Some blog post may contain "Hackerman's tip" sections, which contains some more advanced information for more advanced readers.
And some may contain "Padawan's Playground" sections, which contains some more junior-level info.

## Requirements

### Theming

Two themes: light and dark.
- When site is loaded, system theme should be checked. If it is dark (`window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches`), dark theme should be the default. 
- To watch for system theme changes `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', event =>  event.matches ? "dark" : "light";)`, should change theme of the website.
- Adds `data-theme=light|dark` attr to document
- Adds `light-theme` or `dark-theme` class to body

        Hello, I'm Alex. 
        Welcome to DevSparks, a cosy corner of the web where code meets fun. I've always believed that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to do is by having fun. That's why I've created DevSparks - to share the joy and the power of development with you.
        Here, you'll find bite-sized lifehacks about everything from CLI power usage to git tricks, all crafted with a dash of humor and a bucketload of passion.
        So grab a cup of coffee, get comfy, and let's explore the incredible world of coding together!

### Home page

Contains a "Hacks" title and a list of hacks groupped by year in the format:

```
YEAR

hack title (date)
```

Here is some sample code to list items:

```
{{ range (where .Site.RegularPages "Type" "in" (slice "hacks")).GroupByDate "2006" }}
<h2>{{ .Key }}</h2>
<ul>
  {{ range .Pages }}
  <li>
    <span class="date">{{ .Date.Format (.Site.Params.dateFormat | default "January 2, 2006" ) }}</span>
    <a class="title" href="{{ .Params.externalLink | default .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a>
  </li>
  {{- end -}}
</ul>
{{ end }}
```

On the home page footer should be rendered before main content, not after.

### About page


Hello and welcome to the 'About' page of DevSparks! I'm Alex, and this blog you're exploring is the brainchild of an AI â€” it's developed by a ChatGPT4 based AI tool called [smol-developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer). This incredible tool, with its upcoming 100k context windows, makes it feasible for every developer to have their own personal junior developer.

More info: [GitHub](https://github.com/goooseman/devsparks-blog)

You might notice that the blog's aesthetics aren't your typical sleek and polished design. That's intentional! The somewhat unconventional look is part of the project's charm. The blog regenerates in different versions on a monthly basis, constantly evolving and reshaping, just like the field of AI itself.

While the blog's form changes, we don't forget our past. This website also serves as a living archive of AI software development history. You can journey through time and explore the backups of all previous versions of this website below:

- [20230610-v1.0.0-initial-gpt4](https://1.0.0.devsparks.goooseman.dev)

Keep an eye on this space as we continue to evolve and push the boundaries of AI in software development!

### Hack page

A specific hack page contains:

- Title
- Date
- Tags (listed inline, not as bullet items)
- Text content
- Comments (remark42 integration)

Tags should be links, when clicked other hacks by the same tag should be listed.

Some blog posts can contain "Hackerman's tip" and "Padawan's Playground" sections:
- Those sections have a border of `border-color`. 
- Outside of a border there should be a transparent image of Hackerman or Padawan. Use http://placekitten.com/20/20?theme=light image for light theme and http://placekitten.com/20/20?theme=dark for dark theme.
- This image should be absolute positioned on a border with left: 20% and top: 0. 
- Section should be relative. 
- Section should have 25px margin top and 5px margin bottom to fix image position overflow. 
- Title inside section should be italic.
- Please create reusable `{{< hackermans-tip >}}` and `{{< padawans-playground >}}` shortcodes

Please create one example of a hack with Lorem Ipsum text containing both Padawan and Hackerman sections.

### Remark42 integration

Remark42 is a comments engine which has a special backend and a frontend integration. We have already deployed version at https://remark42.goooseman.dev

### Frontend integration

Add following snippets to end of the body:

```
<script>
  // https://remark42.com/docs/configuration/frontend/
  var remark_config = {
    host: 'https://remark42.goooseman.dev',
    site_id: 'dev_sparks',
    components: ['embed', 'last-comments']
    max_shown_comments: 100,
    theme: {HUGO_THEME},
    page_title: {HUGO_PAGE_TITLE},
    show_email_subscription: false,
    simple_view: true,
    no_footer: false
  }
</script>
```

```
<script>!function(e,n){for(var o=0;o<e.length;o++){var r=n.createElement("script"),c=".js",d=n.head||n.body;"noModule"in r?(r.type="module",c=".mjs"):r.async=!0,r.defer=!0,r.src=remark_config.host+"/web/"+e[o]+c,d.appendChild(r)}}(remark_config.components||["embed"],document);</script>
```

And then add the following `<div>` to the place where footer should be rendered:

```
<div id="remark42"></div>
```

### Frontend theme

Remark42 theme should be syncronised with website theme. When toggle button is clicked, please run the following code: `window.REMARK42.changeTheme("light" | "dark")`
