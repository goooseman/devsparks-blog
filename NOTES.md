# DevSparks Blog Specification

## Overview

DevSparks - short, but meaningful lifehacks for developers. Each lifehack is a short, but fun blog post and a small 5-15 mins video. 

This project is a static blog, which mainly consists of those lifehacks. The posts are written in a coool way with usage of slang. Also blog has "About" page.

The blog itself is strictly technical for at least medium-level developers. Topics are power usage of cli, git tricks, software development principles. 

Some blog post may contain "Hackerman's tip" sections, which contains some more advanced information for more advanced readers.
And some may contain "Padawan's Playground" sections, which contains some more junior-level info.

### Home page

Contains a "Hacks" title and a list of hacks groupped by year in the format:

```
YEAR

hack title (date)
```

Here is some sample code to list items:

```
{{ range (where .Site.RegularPages "Type" "in" (slice "hacks")).GroupByDate "2006" }}
<h2>{{ .Key }}</h2>
<ul>
  {{ range .Pages }}
  <li>
    <span class="date">{{ .Date.Format (.Site.Params.dateFormat | default "January 2, 2006" ) }}</span>
    <a class="title" href="{{ .Params.externalLink | default .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a>
  </li>
  {{- end -}}
</ul>
{{ end }}
```

On the home page footer should be rendered before main content, not after.

### Hack page

A specific hack page contains:

- Title
- Date
- Tags (listed inline, not as bullet items)
- Text content
- Comments (remark42 integration)

Tags should be links, when clicked other hacks by the same tag should be listed.

Some blog posts can contain "Hackerman's tip" and "Padawan's Playground" sections:
- Those sections have a border of `border-color`. 
- Outside of a border there should be a transparent image of Hackerman or Padawan. Use http://placekitten.com/20/20?theme=light image for light theme and http://placekitten.com/20/20?theme=dark for dark theme.
- This image should be absolute positioned on a border with left: 20% and top: 0. 
- Section should be relative. 
- Section should have 25px margin top and 5px margin bottom to fix image position overflow. 
- Title inside section should be italic.

Please create one example of a hack with Lorem Ipsum text containing both Padawan and Hackerman sections.

## Technology Stack

Blog address: `devsparks.goooseman.dev`.

- Back-end: Go, Hugo, Remark42
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactive elements)

Should have Makefile to serve and build project. Both commands should use docker.

### Remark42 integration

Remark42 is a comments engine which has a special backend and a frontend integration.

### Backend

In the projects `docker-compose.yaml` please add following service:

```
version: "2"

services:
  remark:
    # remove the next line in case you want to use this docker-compose separately
    # as otherwise it would complain for absence of Dockerfile
    build: .
    image: umputun/remark42:latest
    container_name: "remark42"
    hostname: "remark42"
    restart: always

    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"

    # uncomment to expose directly (no proxy)
    #ports:
    #  - "80:8080"
    #  - "443:8443"

    environment:
      - REMARK_URL=https://remark42.goooseman.dev
      - SECRET
      - DEBUG=true
      - AUTH_ANON=true 
      - AUTH_GOOGLE_CID
      - AUTH_GOOGLE_CSEC
      - AUTH_GITHUB_CID
      - AUTH_GITHUB_CSEC
      - AUTH_FACEBOOK_CID
      - AUTH_FACEBOOK_CSEC
      - AUTH_DISQUS_CID
      - AUTH_DISQUS_CSEC
      # Enable it only for the initial comment import or for manual backups.
      # Do not leave the server running with the ADMIN_PASSWD set if you don't have an intention
      # to keep creating backups manually!
      # - ADMIN_PASSWD=<your secret password>
    volumes:
      - ./var:/srv/var
```

But enrich this file with hugo image to serve and build commands.

### Frontend integration

Add following snippets to end of the body:

```
<script>
  // https://remark42.com/docs/configuration/frontend/
  var remark_config = {
    host: 'https://remark42.goooseman.dev',
    site_id: 'dev_sparks',
    components: ['embed', 'last-comments']
    max_shown_comments: 100,
    theme: {HUGO_THEME},
    page_title: {HUGO_PAGE_TITLE},
    show_email_subscription: false,
    simple_view: true,
    no_footer: false
  }
</script>
```

```
<script>!function(e,n){for(var o=0;o<e.length;o++){var r=n.createElement("script"),c=".js",d=n.head||n.body;"noModule"in r?(r.type="module",c=".mjs"):r.async=!0,r.defer=!0,r.src=remark_config.host+"/web/"+e[o]+c,d.appendChild(r)}}(remark_config.components||["embed"],document);</script>
```

And then add the following `<div>` to the place where footer should be rendered:

```
<div id="remark42"></div>
```

### Frontend theme

Remark42 theme should be syncronised with website theme. When toggle button is clicked, please run the following code: `window.REMARK42.changeTheme("light" | "dark")`
