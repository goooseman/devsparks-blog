# DevSparks Blog Specification

## Overview

DevSparks - short, but meaningful lifehacks for developers. Each lifehack is a short, but fun blog post and a small 5-15 mins video. 

This project is a static blog, which mainly consists of those lifehacks. The posts are written in a coool way with usage of slang. Also blog has "About" page.

The blog itself is strictly technical for at least medium-level developers. Topics are power usage of cli, git tricks, software development principles. 

Some blog post may contain "Hackerman's tip" sections, which contains some more advanced information for more advanced readers.
And some may contain "Padawan's Playground" sections, which contains some more junior-level info.

## Design Requirements

The design is minimalistic and contains two themes: light and dark. By default the system theme is used, but website should have a special toggle.

Main color is Amber: #ffc000. 

A monospace Fira Code font with ligatures should be used.

For light theme (`.light-theme`) the background is Amber and text color is graphite.
For dark theme (`.dark-theme`) the background is graphite and text color is amber. 

The layout:
- breakpoints: >680px - desktop, <680px mobile
- container: 600px on desktop, or 100% with 20px padding on mobile
- header: 
  - contains navigation links Hacks, Search box, Fix typo
  - Currently opened link should have `.link-active` class
  - .link-active/hovered link should be underlined 
  - search is a horizontal line when not active/hover, and bordered when active/hover. color of line/border should match text color for current theme. placeholder text should also be of text color
  - Fix typo link and switch theme switch should be on the right, all other elements on the left
- main area
  - background color matches other areas of the website. but it has background shadow on top/bottom to make it look like lower then header and footer
- footer
  - contains photo of the author with transparent bg and a small about text. text is wrapped with a single border around whole text, not single parapgraph, of current color text for the current theme
  - should have flex layout
  - for desktop photo on the left column, text on the right
  - for mobile photo is aligned to center and above the text

## Tech Requirements

Should have Makefile to serve and build project. Both commands should use docker. 

Should have a command in this Makefile to re-generate project with smol-dev. Command name: `smol-rewrite`, command: `python3 ../developer/main_no_modal.py ./NOTES.md `


## Functional Requirements

### Home page

Contains a "Hacks" title and a list of hacks groupped by year in the format:

```
YEAR

hack title (date)
```

Here is some sample code to list items:

```
{{ range (where .Site.RegularPages "Type" "in" (slice "hacks")).GroupByDate "2006" }}
<h2>{{ .Key }}</h2>
<ul>
  {{ range .Pages }}
  <li>
    <span class="date">{{ .Date.Format (.Site.Params.dateFormat | default "January 2, 2006" ) }}</span>
    <a class="title" href="{{ .Params.externalLink | default .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a>
  </li>
  {{- end -}}
</ul>
{{ end }}
```

### Hack page

A specific hack page contains:

- Title
- Date
- Tags
- Text content
- Comments (remark42 integration)

Some blog posts can contain "Hackerman's tip" and "Padawan's Playground" sections, which should be highlighted with a border around the text. Border should be of text color which is different for ligth and dark themes Outside of a border there should be a transparent image of Hackerman or Padawan. As of now use a placeholder (http://placekitten.com/20/20) image for light theme and http://placekitten.com/21/21 for dark theme, I will replace them with a real image later. This image should be absolute positioned on a border with left: 20% and top: 0. Section should be relative. Section should have 25px margin top and 5px margin bottom to fix image position overflow. Title inside section should be italic.

Please create one example of a hack with Lorem Ipsum text containing both Padawan and Hackerman sections.

### Header

- Fix typo button just opens following link in a new tab: "https://github.com/goooseman/devsparks-blog/issues/new?title=DevSparks+Feedback&body=I+found+something+wrong+on+this+page%3A%0A%0A++{CURRENT_PAGE}%0A%0A++Here%27s+what+it+is%3A"
- Toogle theme switch:
  - Adds `data-theme` attr to document
  - Adds `light-theme` or `dark-theme` class to body
  - `window.REMARK42.changeTheme("light" | "dark")`
  - Should consist of ðŸŒž icon if active theme is dark and ðŸŒ’ icon if current theme is light
  - Should have aria-label: 'Switch to light theme' if current theme is dark and 'Switch to dark theme' if current theme is light
  - Default theme should be selected from system one:
    - `window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches` -> dark mode if true
    - `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', event =>  event.matches ? "dark" : "light";` to watch for changes

### Footer

The footer should consist of my photo (http://placekitten.com/200/200) with transparent background and following about text: 

> Hello, I'm Alex. 
> Welcome to DevSparks, a cosy corner of the web where code meets fun. I've always believed that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to do is by having fun. That's why I've created DevSparks - to share the joy and the power of development with you.

> So grab a cup of coffee, get comfy, and let's explore the incredible world of coding together!

## Technology Stack

Blog address: `devsparks.goooseman.dev`.

- Back-end: Go, Hugo, Remark42
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactive elements)

### Remark42 integration

Remark42 is a comments engine which has a special backend and a frontend integration.

### Backend

In the projects `docker-compose.yaml` please add following service:

```
version: "2"

services:
  remark:
    # remove the next line in case you want to use this docker-compose separately
    # as otherwise it would complain for absence of Dockerfile
    build: .
    image: umputun/remark42:latest
    container_name: "remark42"
    hostname: "remark42"
    restart: always

    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"

    # uncomment to expose directly (no proxy)
    #ports:
    #  - "80:8080"
    #  - "443:8443"

    environment:
      - REMARK_URL=https://remark42.goooseman.dev
      - SECRET
      - DEBUG=true
      - AUTH_ANON=true 
      - AUTH_GOOGLE_CID
      - AUTH_GOOGLE_CSEC
      - AUTH_GITHUB_CID
      - AUTH_GITHUB_CSEC
      - AUTH_FACEBOOK_CID
      - AUTH_FACEBOOK_CSEC
      - AUTH_DISQUS_CID
      - AUTH_DISQUS_CSEC
      # Enable it only for the initial comment import or for manual backups.
      # Do not leave the server running with the ADMIN_PASSWD set if you don't have an intention
      # to keep creating backups manually!
      # - ADMIN_PASSWD=<your secret password>
    volumes:
      - ./var:/srv/var
```

But enrich this file with hugo image to serve and build commands.

### Frontend integration

Add following snippets to end of the body:

```
<script>
  // https://remark42.com/docs/configuration/frontend/
  var remark_config = {
    host: 'https://remark42.goooseman.dev',
    site_id: 'dev_sparks',
    components: ['embed', 'last-comments']
    max_shown_comments: 100,
    theme: {HUGO_THEME},
    page_title: {HUGO_PAGE_TITLE},
    show_email_subscription: false,
    simple_view: true,
    no_footer: false
  }
</script>
```

```
<script>!function(e,n){for(var o=0;o<e.length;o++){var r=n.createElement("script"),c=".js",d=n.head||n.body;"noModule"in r?(r.type="module",c=".mjs"):r.async=!0,r.defer=!0,r.src=remark_config.host+"/web/"+e[o]+c,d.appendChild(r)}}(remark_config.components||["embed"],document);</script>
```

And then add the following `<div>` to the place where footer should be rendered:

```
<div id="remark42"></div>
```

### Frontend theme

Remark42 theme should be syncronised with website theme. When toggle button is clicked, please run the following code: `window.REMARK42.changeTheme("light" | "dark")`
