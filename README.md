# DevSparks 💡

DevSparks offers a collection of **short** and **meaningful** developer lifehacks. Each lifehack is composed of a brief blog post and a 5-15 minute video. Our content is wrapped in a light-hearted, slang-laden narrative style.

This project is a static blog composed primarily of these developer lifehacks.
